## Part 2. Problems

#### Problem 1. Personal data

a.  I can sort my hydration levels into 2 groups, Low Water Intake and High Water Intake, and find the mean productivity level, from a scale of 1-5, for each group. This would be informative because I think I am *generally* more productive on days where I am more hydrated.

b.  Visualization

    ```{r}
    #| message: FALSE
    # create "my_data" object from "my_data.csv" from "data" folder
    my_data <- read_csv("data/my_data.csv", skip = 1) 

    # clean data and create columns
    my_data <- my_data %>%
      mutate(Water = as.numeric(`Water (oz)`), # convert to numeric values and store in column "Water"
             Productivity = as.numeric(`Productivity (1-5)`), # convert to numeric values and store in column "Productivity"
             Hydration_Level = if_else(Water >= 32, "High Water Intake", "Low Water Intake")) # create new column "Hydration_Level" based on Water with threshold of 32 oz

    # create the plot
    ggplot(my_data, aes(x = Hydration_Level, y = Productivity, color = Hydration_Level)) +
      geom_jitter(width = 0.3, alpha = 0.8) + # add jittered points 
      stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "crossbar", width = 0.5, color = "darkgrey") + # add horizontal bar to show mean productivity for both hydration groups
      scale_color_manual(values = c("High Water Intake" = "cadetblue", "Low Water Intake" = "salmon")) + # manually set colors for both hydration groups
      labs(x = "Hydration Level", # label x-axis
           y = "Productivity (1-5)", # label y-axis
           title = "Impact of Hydration on Productivity Levels", # create title
           caption = "Productivity levels grouped by Low and High Water Intake (Hydration Levels).\nMy mean productivity is higher on days with ≥32 ounces (oz) of water intake,\n which indicates a possible positive") + # add caption
      theme_minimal() + # use minimal theme 
      theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5,
                                        size = 10, 
                                        margin = margin(t = 10))) + # align caption 
      theme(legend.position = "none") # hide legend 

    ```

c.  Add caption: Productivity levels grouped by Low and High Water Intake (Hydration Levels). My mean productivity is higher on days with ≥32 ounces (oz) of water intake, which indicates a possible positive relationship between hydration and productivity.

d.  Table presentation

```{r}
# create summary_table and calculate summary statistics
summary_table <- my_data %>% # pipe "my_data" into summary table
  group_by(Hydration_Level) %>% # group data by "Hydration_Level"
  # calculate summary statistics for each group
  summarise(Mean_Productivity = round(mean(Productivity, na.rm = TRUE), 1), # Mean of "Productivity", rounded to 1 decimal place, ignore missing values
            Min_Productivity = min(Productivity, na.rm = TRUE), # minimum "Productivity" value, ignore missing values 
            Max_Productivity = max(Productivity, na.rm = TRUE)) # maximum "Productivity" value, ignore missing values 

summary_table %>% # use gt to create formatted table from above summary
  gt() %>% # convert summary_table to a gt table object
  tab_header(title = "Productivity Summary Based on Hydration Level") %>% # add table title
  cols_label(Hydration_Level = "Hydration Level", # change name to "Hydration Level"
             Mean_Productivity = "Mean Productivity", # change name to "Mean Productivity"
             Min_Productivity = "Minimum", # change name to "Minimum"
             Max_Productivity = "Maximum") # change name to "Maximum"
```

## Problem 2. Affective visualization

a.  An affective visualization for my personal data could be something like a quilt with various colors to represent different productivity levels and the size of each square being large or small depending on high or low hydration levels. It could also include small symbols within each square to show which extraneous factors could also be involved, like sleep, caffeinated drinks, screen time, and outside time. This visualization would make the data I collected easy to follow without having to interperet the data that heavily since the colors and symbols will represent all of the contributing factors and resulting productivity levels. All this being said, I do not think I have the time and/or materials to make a quilt with this project, even though I think this would be the best representation, so I will opt for a drawing that conveys the same message, drawing the squares and symbols instead of quilting them.

b.  This is the rough sketch of the above visualization, I still need to work out some of the proportions, color scheme, etc., but that will be worked out for the next part (question c.). ![](images/IMG_72DC1FAE5157-1-01.jpeg)

c.  This is a rough draft of my visualization:
